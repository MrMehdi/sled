# sled: The satanic LED controller. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shinyblink/sled.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shinyblink/sled)

Modular LED Matrix controller.

# Manual
Read the Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey.

# Hardware

Matrix consisting of ws2812b pixels.
Minimum recommended size is 8x8, anything less and you won't see much of the effects.

Can handle a ~~maximum 256x256~~ pretty ridiculous matrix (switched to ints) in either plain or snake tiling.
Plain means every row starts with the left pixel, while snake means it changes starting position every tile.
Both start upper left, as that is (0, 0) for this code.

Connected to the ports of the specific board you're using.

* Raspberry Pi (Zero): See https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x
	- I can recommend using PCM, little chance it is used. It is used by default. Pin 40 on the Zero.
	- You might need a level shifter to shift the 3.3V logic level to 5V the strips want.

* ESP8266 DevBoard with UDP Sketch
	- Uses output D2 by default, but you can use almost anything the Adafruit NeoPixel library supports.
	- You might need a level shifter to shift the 3.3V logic level to 5V the strips want.

# Software

Common:
* Some C99 compiler
* Some libc
* GNU Make

Platforms might need additional dependencies, check below.

Your local SLED configuration is in `sledconf`, which is thus .gitignore'd by default.
Examples are given in the Makefiles directory, check `sledconf.*`.
It can override various settings:

* `PROJECT`
	- The name of the final binary.
	- Defaults to 'sled'.

* `PLATFORM`
	- The platform being compiled for.
	- Defaults to 'unix'.
	- See src/os_unix.c and similar.

* `DEBUG`
	- Set to 1 to add debug information to all files and disable -O2.
	- Defaults to 0.

* `CFLAGS`
	- Defaults to `-O2 -march=native` or `-march=native -Og -ggdb` dependent on `DEBUG`.

* `STATIC`
	- Set to 1 to use static linking.
	- Set to 0 to use -ldl based linking.
	- Defaults to 0.

* `DEFAULT_OUTMOD`
	- The default -o parameter.
	- Defaults to "sdl2".

* `DEFAULT_MODULEDIR`
	- The default -m parameter.
	- Defaults to "./modules".

* `MODULES`
	- The modules being compiled.
	- `MODULES_AVAILABLE` contains all available GFX modules.
	- Default is this & DEFAULT_OUTMOD prefixed with `out_`.

Compile with simply `make`.

# Output modules

* `out_sdl2`
	- SDL2-based virtual matrix for development.

* `out_rpi_ws2812b`
	- Uses https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x to drive the strips.
	- Uses PCM, DMA channel 10 and SoC pin 21/RPI header pin 40 by default.

* `out_udp`
	- UDP output following the protocol of CalcProgrammer1/KeyboardVisualizer's LED strip output.
	- An ESP8266 Arduino sketch will be uploaded here soon. In the meantime, CalcProgrammer1's repository has a compatible sketch, I believe.

* `out_rpi_hub75`
	- A backend that drives HUB75-style matrices using https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix
	- Does *not* use `MATRIX_X`/`MATRIX_Y`, as that's a bit more complicated.
	- Instead, use `./sled -o "rpi_hub75:--led-rows=32 --led-cols=64 --led-multiplexing=1 --led-chain=2 --led-pixel-mapper=U-mapper"`, for example. Arguments are explained at the library's project page.

# Modules

By default, only modules with zero dependencies are built. Apart from the output modules, of course.
They are the following:

## Effects/Graphic Modules
* `gfx_random_static`: Randomized static color.

* `gfx_random_rects`: Random colored rectangle animation.
	- Note, your matrix axies have to be dividable by 4.

* `gfx_twinkle`: Twinkle, twinkle, little star? Made by @20kdc.

* `gfx_text`: Displays text using custom proportional font. Made by @20kdc.
	- "Hack me" greeting by default, obviously. 8x8 or bigger required.

* `bgm_fish`: FIfo Shell. A small FIFO-based queue manipulator. Made by @20kdc.
	- Shouldn't have background CPU usage as of the select abuse. Creates `sled.fish` FIFO in the sled tree.

* `gfx_gol`: A simple black and white Conway's Game of Life clone.

* `gfx_golc`: A Conway's Game of Life clone; with fading, color inheritance and loop detection, made by @orithena.

* `gfx_rainbow`: A simple rainbow animation.

* `gfx_math_sinpi`: A sinus curve of Pi.

* `gfx_plasma`: A plasma animation, ported from borgware.

* `gfx_balls`: Small ball animation.

* `gfx_checkerboard`: A checkerboard animation.

* `gfx_clock`: A digital clock.

* `gfx_sinematrix`: A psychedelic matrix manipulation effect, made by @orithena.

* `gfx_affinematrix`: A billowing matrix manipulation effect, made by @orithena.

* `gfx_candyflow`: A tweak of `gfx_affinematrix` to look like candy colored lava, made by @orithena.

* `gfx_sinefield`: A strange effect that emerged while whacking random math functions into a loop, made by @orithena.

* `bgm_opc`: An OpenPixelControl server, displays things when it is written to.

* `gfx_bttrblls`: Tweak of `gfx_balls` with fractional speeds and less noisy colors. by @cyriax0

* `gfx_sort1`: 2D partial bubblesort on color ranges, may change direction. by @cyriax0

* `gfx_starfield`: Fly through random stars executing random turns. by @cyriax0

If you want to only build a specific set of modules, pass a `MODULES="myfavouritemodule bestmodule"` to the `make` line.

If you want to build a specific module later on, you can do the same but with just the
module you wanna build. It'll get added to the same directory where the others are.
Or, if you are particularly lazy, just add the module name to the make invocation.

# Support
Support for sled is done on a if-i-can-find-the-time basis. Mostly, this project is for myself.
I'll try to help everyone, but I might take some time.



If you'd like to support my work or me in general, I have a [donation page](https://i0i0.me/donateme.html).
Anything is highly appreciated. If you are donating via PayPal, please set a message so I can thank you!

Most of the donations tracable to anything sled related will be spend buying different LED matrices and other hardware.

Plus, buying cola and booze. ;)
